# NeuralNetwork
<br>
In no way am I actually qualified. the Upgraded Neural Network is merely a translation of the Python Neural Network. Knowing that Java doesn't actually have dot product (well technically, for 2D arrays such as the synapses/weights linking from each input to output, it is matrix multiplication), the function is written in. 
<br> <br> Also - arrayMult is a bad function name, but this is basically when each respective value of the matrix is multiplied by the value in the same place on another matrix.
<br> <br> i.e. [[2,4],[1,3]] * [[0,5],[3,4] = [[0,20],[3,12]]

The part I've added is the MultiLayer Neural Network - which has 2 Hidden Layers, as opposed to the first one.
