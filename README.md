# NeuralNetwork
<br>
In no way am I actually qualified. In no way is this translation even that impressive. the Upgraded Neural Network is merely a translation of the Python Neural Network. Knowing that Java doesn't actually have dot product (well technically, for 2D arrays such as the synapses/weights linking from each input to output, it is matrix multiplication), the function is written in.

<br>
The part I've added is the MultiLayer Neural Network - which has 2 Hidden Layers, as opposed to the first one.

Future projects based on this will come out in the near future, stay tuned.
