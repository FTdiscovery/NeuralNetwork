# NeuralNetwork
<br>
In no way am I actually qualified. In no way is this translation even that impressive. the Upgraded Neural Network is merely a translation of the Python Neural Network. Knowing that Java doesn't actually have dot product (well technically, for 2D arrays such as the synapses/weights linking from each input to output, it is matrix multiplication), the function is written in.

correction i actually learnt how it works and can really really shadily explain
<br>
The part I've added is the MultiLayer Neural Network - which has 2 Hidden Layers, as opposed to the first one.

Future projects based on this will come out in the near future, stay tuned. <br> <br>

<br> For this, the computer will quite often mess up and give you weird values. If so, there are three solutions: a) decrease the sample size - I only have 40 words for Chinese and English each, b) keep the character length roughly the same, c) decrease the amount of neurons, or amount of hidden layers. Remember this has two layers, so if you have a lot of neurons in the hidden layers, that's a lot of work. You can decrease it to one layer.
