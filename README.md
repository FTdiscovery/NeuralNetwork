# NeuralNetwork
<br>
In no way am I actually qualified. Sad!
<br>

This takes advantage of mxjava, a Matrix Multiplication function library that I have created. Yay?

Future projects based on this will come out in the near future, stay tuned. <br> <br>
<br> <b> #1 Boring Project: Language Predictor! </b>
<br> For this, the computer will quite often mess up and give you weird values. If so, there are three solutions: a) decrease the sample size - I only have 157 words for Chinese and English in total, b) keep the character length roughly the same, c) decrease the amount of neurons, or amount of hidden layers. Remember this has two layers, so if you have a lot of neurons in the hidden layers, that's a lot of work. You can decrease it to one layer.
